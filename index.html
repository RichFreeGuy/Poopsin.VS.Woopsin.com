        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>
            "Poopsin vs. Woopsin: Battle for the Butthole" is a fast-paced, side-scrolling action platformer where two unlikely heroes,
            Poopsin and Woopsin, battle their way out of the ultimate bio-hazardous terrain – a butthole. Players will control these
            quirky characters, navigating treacherous levels filled with unpredictable traps, hazardous enemies, and squishy obstacles
            to escape the dreaded Big Flush.
        </p>

    <section id="characters">
        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <h3>Poopsin</h3>
        <p>
            Poopsin is the determined, gritty protagonist. His no-nonsense attitude and brute strength give him a slight edge
            in hand-to-hand combat. With abilities like the "Turd Tornado" and "Gas Dash," he can fight his way through even the
            toughest obstacles.
        </p>

        <h3>Woopsin</h3>
        <p>
            Woopsin is chaotic, agile, and a bit unpredictable. He moves faster than Poopsin and can summon small dukie minions to
            assist him in battle. His slide ability helps him navigate tight spaces, while his "Confusion Cloud" disorients enemies.

        <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
        <h3>Movement & Combat</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Jumping & Wall-Climbing:</strong> Players can jump between walls, with Poopsin's sticky abilities allowing him to cling to walls longer.</li>
            <li><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> Both characters have unique attacks. Poopsin's "Turd Tornado" deals AoE damage, while Woopsin's "Confusion Cloud" stuns enemies.</li>
            <li><strong>Slide Maneuver:</strong> Woopsin can slide through tight, slippery spots in the butthole environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Environmental Hazards</h3>
        <p>
            The butthole is not a friendly place. As players move deeper, they'll encounter different obstacles like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Slippery Floors:</strong> Sections of the map become harder to navigate due to smooth, slippery floors.</li>
            <li><strong>Clogged Pathways:</strong> Some areas are blocked by large dukie monsters that need to be fought off or avoided.</li>
            <li><strong>Flushing Events:</strong> At certain intervals, the butthole undergoes a "Big Flush" which causes the environment to shift rapidly, making platforming harder.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="levels">
        <h2>Levels</h2>
        <h3>Level 1: The Entry Tunnel</h3>
        <p>
            Players start at the beginning of the butthole, where the terrain is more forgiving. However, the deeper they go, the more challenging
            the obstacles become. Players must avoid sticky walls, low-velocity gas vents, and smaller dukie minions.
        </p>

        <h3>Level 2: Colon Chaos</h3>
        <p>
            The colon area introduces new hazards like bouncing platforms and slippery pathways. Enemies become tougher, and players
            need to work together or outsmart each other to survive.
        </p>

        <h3>Level 3: Rectum Rampage</h3>
        <p>
            The final level is an intense rush to the exit. The butthole environment constantly shifts as players try to avoid incoming flushes
            and defeat the final dukie boss.
        </p>
